# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

### What is HTML?
HTML is the language used for web documents. It is not a programming language, but rather a markup language 
(that identifies the meaning, purpose, and structure of text within a document).
* HTML is the most basic building block of the Web
* Allowed publishing and exchanging of scientific  and technical documents
* Allowed electronic linking of documents via hyperlinks
* Allowed sharing multimedia elements 
* Support Geolocation sharing on user approval


### The General Rule
HTML encapsulate contents between elements. For example:   
``<tagName> Some Content </tagName>``

### HTML History and Development
* **Created in 1989/1990.**
* Its roots go back to at least 1980, with [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)‘s project [ENQUIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE). 
* Actually, the concept of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) goes back even further than that. 
  The concept first appeared in the early 1940s, and was named and demonstrated in the 1960s.
* In 1989, Lee proposed a new hypertext system based on the ideas of ENQUIRE. This became the first version of what we now call HTML.
* The specification of HTML is managed by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/), 
  and the [Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](https://whatwg.org/) since then.
* HTML Versions ([in details](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/historyofhtml.html)):
  * HTML 1.0
  * HTML 2.0
  * HTML 3.0
  * HTML 3.2
  * HTML 4.01
  * XHTML 1.0
  * HTML5

* **Audio & Video** − You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.

* **Geolocation** − Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.
